		<p>
		This is, by any means, far from being a perfect infinite scroller. It does not have the loading gif while retrieving the new content, nor it deals with the dynamic url inputs and many other detailed stuffs. For the simplicity of the demo, this is just a very simple and basic implementation of infinite scroller. And the diagram for the code structure is shown above in the banner.
